the main editing will be in the policy-service not here .
but it was important to mention and create a branch for it in case to easy roll back.
but way NER ?
searching for "how to install docker in linux" isn't similar to "how to install chrome in linux"
or "how to install docker in windows"
so the key should not be "how to install docker in linux" it should be something like "how to install APPLICATION in OS"
